I am a first year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Dongdong She](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~dongdong/).
Before coming to HKUST, I earned my bachelor’s degree at Xidian University.

My research focuses on the intersection of AI for Security and Security for AI.
On the AI for Security side, I leverage large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning techniques to detect and analyze security vulnerabilities in AI agents and traditional software systems.
On the Security for AI side, I investigate methods to safeguard LLMs themselves, addressing challenges such as watermark robustness, privacy leakage, and prompt injection attacks.
I worked with with [Prof. Xinlei He](https://xinleihe.github.io/) and [Prof. Tianshuo Cong](https://tianshuocong.github.io/) from 2023.10 to 2024.7.

## Publications

```blog-bib

@comment
{
Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
