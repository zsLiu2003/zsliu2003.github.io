Iâ€™m a senior student in the School of Cyber Security at Xidian University. I am also an incoming Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST) with the supervision of [Prof. Dongdong She](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~dongdong/).

I had a wonderful internship experience from 2023-10 to 2024-6 with [Prof. Xinlei He](https://xinleihe.github.io/) and [Prof. Tianshuo Cong](https://tianshuocong.github.io/) at Tsinghua University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou).

## Pre-prints

```blog-bib

@pub{
    author = {\textbf{Zesen Liu} and Tianshuo Cong and Xinlei He and Qi Li},
    title = {On Evaluating The Performance of Watermarked Machine-Generated Texts Under Adversarial Attacks},

## Publications

```blog-bib

@comment
{
Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
